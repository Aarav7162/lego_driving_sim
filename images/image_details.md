## Steering Wheel

1. **Steering-Wheel-Front-View**
   
   This is the steering wheel

2. **Steering-Wheel-Side-View**
   
   There is a C.V joint that allows the steering wheel to be used at an angle. An axle can also be seen going to the final mechanism.

3. **Steering-Wheel-Back-View**
   
   The Xbox controller can now clearly be seen. The mechanisim that controls it can also be seen. Its just a beam that extends in both directions. A gear is added below (1:3 ratio) to create some torque and add resistence.

## Pedals

1. **Pedals-Front-View**
   
   You can see the two pedals. The one at the left is the brake, while the one on the right is acceleration. The Xbox controller and the air tank (thumbs up bottle) can be seen

2. **Pedals-Side-View1**
   
   (Sorry for the bad image quality) Here, you can see the first pneumatic piston (braking). It is modded to let less air pass through and add more pressure. The IR sensor can be seen, and it checks the distance between the pedal and itself to decide wether key S should be pressed or not.

3. **Pedals-Side-View2**
   
   Here, you can see the second pneumatic piston. It is modded to let air flow through faster. This is the accelerator pedal.
